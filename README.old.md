React Code Challenge: Flag Picker


Challenge: 

Build a generic search component using React JS that allows the user to pick different world flags based on the provided JSON file (attached to this email).

Instructions: 

1. Build a generic search box React component that uses its children as the options

2. Filter these options based on the user's input (typeahead functionality)

3. Use the continents as the options for the first search box. The options for this search box should be clickable and, when selecting an option, it should filter the second search box options

4. Use the countries as the options for the second search box. The options for this search box should be checkboxes that allow the user to select multiple countries

5. Display country flags based on the options selected in the second search box

5. Build Unit tests for your search box component 

6. Feel free to style the page however you’d like, but the functionality should resemble the video as closely as possible

Bonus: 

1. Creativity with design and styling

2. Build navigation with the up and down keystrokes for the search box options and make them selectable with the Enter key

Time limit for the challenge: 24 hours

Requirements: 

- Use Create React App https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

- Don’t use any additional libraries

- Only use the provided JSON file (as is) for the search boxes options 

- Use the same component for both search boxes
